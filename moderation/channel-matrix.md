|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| #general-chat     | Broadly permissive: self-referential, community, satire, creator tropes, ND humor, light trash talk | Targeted harassment, slurs, identity-based attacks |
| #serious-discussion | Strict: minimal stereotypes, focus on topic, only self-referential allowed | All stereotypes discouraged, off-topic humor blocked |
| #trauma-support   | Only self-referential and gentle community trauma humor | Targeting, weaponizing trauma, identity-based jokes |
| #nsfw-kink        | Highly permissive for kink humor, self-referential, ND/kink tropes | Kink-shaming, slurs, identity-based harassment |
| #nd-hangout       | Highly permissive for ND humor, self-referential, in-group jokes | Weaponizing ND traits, slurs, identity-based attacks |
| #gaming-vc        | Permissive: trash talk, creator tropes, ND humor, satire | Genuine hostility, targeted harassment, slurs |

**Notes:**
- Mods intervene when jokes cross into harassment or weaponization.
- Context and speaker identity matter for enforcement.
- Channel-specific ephemeral onboarding messages recommended.
