# Launch Narrative

Neuronucleus turns neurodivergent identity into a badge of power. The prelaunch window is about meeting the community where they already gather, giving them something tangible to align around, and making it painfully obvious that this brand understands cognitive safety, voice inclusion, and operational rigor.

- **Mission**: Normalize neurodivergent strength through apparel, storytelling, and community-powered tooling.
- **Promise**: Every asset—merch drop, content series, AI ritual—keeps execution friction-free for brains that refuse to run neurotypical firmware.
- **Proof**: Documented architecture, compliance controls, and a living roadmap that shows exactly how launch hits production.
