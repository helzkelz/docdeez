## Guiding Principles & Mission Alignment

All offerings adhere to core principles: "Your Body, Your Data" (privacy-first), "Powered by Your Brain" (adaptive intelligence), "Safe Chaos is Good Chaos" (trauma-informed design), and "Community Over Algorithm" (contribution-based visibility). The mission is to create a neurodivergent-safe, sex-positive, creativity-centered space where visibility is earned through contribution, not exploitation.
