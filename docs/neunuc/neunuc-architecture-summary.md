# Neunuc AI-Powered Platform: Complete Architecture Diagrams & Reference

I've created a comprehensive multi-diagram visualization of your Neunuc platform with complete system mapping, specifications, and reference guides. Here's what has been delivered:

## 📊 Visual Diagrams Generated

**Diagram 1: Complete Architecture & Data Flow**
A full layered architecture showing all components from user interfaces at the top (mobile, web, voice, Discord) through the central BethyOps orchestrator with parallel core IP agents (FlexCore, LogVault, SaboteurTracker, ClarityDaemon), down to backend infrastructure (Supabase, Firebase, Redis, Cloud Storage) and external integrations (OpenAI, Google, Ko-fi, Printful, etc.). Color-coded by function: green for user interfaces, red for core agents, blue for infrastructure, orange for orchestration, yellow for external services, and purple for compliance systems.

**Diagram 2: Orchestration Logic & Compliance Subsystems**
Detailed flow showing how BethyOps processes voice input in parallel with all core IP agents, decision logic for risk detection and Safe-Mode activation, and parallel automation/compliance subsystems. Highlights event-driven functions, scheduled Discord tasks, Redis queue, CI/CD pipeline, consent tracking, COPPA gates, content moderation, and trauma-informed safety routing.

**Diagram 3: Multi-Layer Data Flow & Integration Matrix**
Hierarchical data flow showing user input channels feeding into the central orchestrator, backend infrastructure layer, and external integrations. Arrows labeled with data types. Shows complete integration architecture with AI services, monetization platforms, and cloud infrastructure.

## 🔐 Compliance & Automation Subsystems

**Automation (Orange)**:

- Event-driven Firebase Cloud Functions
- Discord.js scheduled rituals
- Redis async job queue
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Scheduled admin tasks via Godmode
- Append-only ledger updates

**Compliance (Purple)**:
