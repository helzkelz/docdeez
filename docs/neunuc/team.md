# Team

HelenKella is powered by a diverse team of neurodivergent creators, developers, and advocates committed to building a platform that empowers rather than exploits. We believe in transparency, autonomy, and community-driven innovation.

## Core Team

### Helen (Founder & Visionary)
Helen is the heart of HelenKella—a neurodivergent survivor, creator, and systems thinker who turned personal chaos into a scalable OS. With lived experience in trauma, addiction recovery, and advocacy, Helen designs every feature with empathy and edge. She's the architect behind our consent-first philosophy and "Safe Chaos is Good Chaos" mantra.

- **Why HelenKella?** "I built this because the systems failed me—and I refuse to let them fail others."
