This page breaks down the major **sub-systems** of the HelenKella Neunuc System and their responsibilities.

---

## Bethy: AI Voice Orchestrator

Bethy is the **primary interface & orchestrator**.

### Responsibilities

- Receive user input (voice, chat, CLI, Discord, etc.)
- Parse intent, emotional tone, and urgency
- Route requests to:
  - Synaptic Cortex Nexus
  - Neunuc ARR Loop
  - Neuro-Navigator
  - Integration workers
- Maintain conversational state and context
- Apply Humor SOP and Ethos Navigator constraints before responding

Bethy is not just a chat UI. It is an **orchestration layer** that turns human intent into structured system actions.

---

## Synaptic Cortex Nexus

The **Synaptic Cortex Nexus** is the core reasoning engine.

### Responsibilities

- Interpret problem frames from Bethy
- Plan and generate solutions using:
  - LLMs
  - Tools (data access, integrations)
  - Knowledge Graph queries
- Produce structured outputs:
  - Plans
  - Checklists
  - Refactored workflows
  - Recommended interventions

It is designed to model **neurodivergent workflows**, not just generic “tasks.”

---

## Neunuc: Adaptive Roadmap Review (ARR) Loop

The **Neunuc ARR Loop** implements an **ongoing planning cycle**.

### Responsibilities

- Continuously assess:
  - Current tasks and incidents
  - Calendar load
  - User-supplied energy and cognitive state
- Reconcile short-term and long-term goals
- Propose updates to:
  - Priorities
  - Scopes
  - Timelines
- Feed back into the Knowledge Graph as “learning” from each cycle

Neunuc effectively provides **executive function as a service**.

---

## Neuro-Navigator

The **Neuro-Navigator** is focused on **neurodivergent & trauma-aware support**.

> Note: This system is not a replacement for clinical care. It is designed for **support and structure**, not diagnosis or therapy.

### Responsibilities

- Interpret the user’s `neuro_profile` and context
- Adapt all outputs to:
  - Break down tasks into manageable steps
  - Minimize decision fatigue
  - Reduce context-switching
- Offer supportive structures such as:
  - Co-working style flows
  - Scripts for difficult conversations
  - Recovery-aware pacing suggestions

---

## Ethos Navigator

The **Ethos Navigator** ensures **verifiable trust and adaptive culture**.

### Responsibilities

- Enforce rules of:
  - What the system is allowed to access
  - What it’s allowed to automate
  - When explicit approval is required
- Maintain:
  - Audit logs
  - Action rationales
  - Policy versions
- Apply “culture configs” such as:
  - Preferred tone ranges
  - Neurodivergent-friendly norms
  - Communication boundaries

Ethos Navigator is the **ethical spine** of Neunuc.

---

## Humor SOP: Stereotype & Identity Operational Stack

The **Humor SOP** encodes how humor and identity are handled.

### Responsibilities

- Respect user’s preferences for:
  - Tone & language
  - Use and limits of humor
- Avoid:
  - Harmful stereotypes
  - Tokenization or fetishization of neurodivergence
- Use humor as a **functional tool**:
  - Reduce shame
  - Interrupt negative spirals
  - Normalize cognitive variance without trivializing it

Humor SOP works closely with Bethy, Neuro-Navigator, and Ethos Navigator to ensure that communication is both **effective and safe**.
